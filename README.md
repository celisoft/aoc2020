# Advent of code 2020

## Day 1 - Report repair

## Day 2 - Password Philosophy

*Grmbl* With Visual Studio, I have encountered a problem to build the project due to Boost library. 

Use the following command line to correctly include it :

`conan install . -g visual_studio --build missing -s compiler.runtime=MDd`

## Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory

Puzzle 2 was so big that I have to use "long long" to get the result correctly ! Thank @chrsnjk for the tip :)
